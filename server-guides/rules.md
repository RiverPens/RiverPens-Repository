# Rules for Nordics

Disclaimer: The extent of penalties for rule violations will consider factors such as the duration of the offence and the benefits gained. Individuals who have not extensively contravened the rules or derived significant advantages from their actions may receive less severe penalties.

### 1. **Cheating and Technical Issues**&#x20;

**1.1 Use of Cheats:** Those who use any form of cheats, mods, or programs that provide unfair advantages in the game will be convicted of cheating. This includes, but is not limited to, resource and texture packs that conceal certain blocks, speed and flight cheats, and x-ray. Those caught using these will face severe penalties.

**1.1.1 Unauthorized Automation:** Those who use functions to automatically create mouse clicks, movements, keyboard presses, or any other form of automated behavior that may provide advantages will be convicted of unauthorized automation.

**1.2 Assisting in Cheating:** Those who collaborate or trade with players where it is evident that the other player is breaking the prohibition in the previous section will be convicted of assisting in cheating.

**1.3 Exploiting Technical Issues:** Those who exploit obvious technical issues for their own or another player's advantage will be convicted of exploiting technical issues. This also applies to those active through another player account during a ban or suspension.

**1.4 Multi-Accounting:** Those who exploit multiple accounts to generate in-game currency on the server will be convicted of multi-accounting. Role-playing with multiple accounts is allowed.

### 2. Behaviors

&#x20;**2.1 Deception:** Those who intentionally deceive or otherwise knowingly or negligently deceive other players will be convicted of deception. This also applies to those who unlawfully attempt to mimic another player's or moderator's identity or other characteristics on the server.

**2.2 Unlawful Killing:** Those who kill another player will be convicted of unlawful killing. This prohibition does not apply if the killing is in self-defence or if there is an agreement between the victim and the perpetrator that allows killing. (Bounties are available, but if they continue killing as a way of bullying, it will be unlawful)

**2.3 Theft:** Those who unlawfully take items owned by an active player or an active town will be convicted of theft.

**2.4 Livestock Trespass:** Those who unlawfully kill or move animals owned by another player or town will be convicted of livestock trespass.

**2.5 Disobedience to Authority:** Anyone who does not follow the written instructions of the serving moderator is convicted of disobedience against the authorities. Even those who ignore a moderator are convicted of disobedience against the authorities. This applies to both Discord and the server.

**2.6 Incitement to violate rules.** Anyone who incites other players to commit a rule violation is judged for incitement to violate rules.

### 3. Communication channels

**3.1 Inappropriate language use:**  Those who choose careless, inappropriate, unsuitable, or foreign words are judged for inappropriate language use. This includes, but is not limited to, chat, private messages, player names, naming of items, plots and towns, the website, and Discord. By foreign language use, it refers to text written in languages other than Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and English, or languages in a dialect that differs significantly from the common language.

**3.2 Provocation:** Those who intentionally express xenophobia, hatred, threats, sexual innuendos, or revenge are judged for provocation. This includes, but is not limited to, expressions in writing and constructions.

**3.3 Spam:** Anyone who repeats many similar messages in a short time or sends junk messages in any of Nordic's communication channels is judged for spam.

**3.4 Advertising violation:** Those who advertise in order to invite players to another server are judged for advertising violation. Also, those who intentionally use Nordics for commercial purposes are judged for advertising violation.

**3.5 Unlawful opposition:** Those who openly criticize the server, or its moderators in a non-constructive manner are judged for unlawful opposition.

**3.6 Personal data violation:** Those who spread personal information are judged for personal data violation. This includes, among other things, social security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and accounts. It is also not okay to spread other players' account IDs or login information. Even those who repeatedly request other players' personal information/accounts despite being denied are judged for personal data violation.

### 4. Buildings and other constructions

&#x20;**4.1 Vandalism:** Anyone who **unlawfully** destroys or otherwise demolishes creations built by **active** players is judged for vandalism.

**4.2 Unauthorized engineering work:** Anyone who constructs or uses farms where nether wart is automatically planted or harvested is judged for unauthorized engineering work. Unauthorized engineering work also applies to those who build redstone circuits, elytra cannons, or other constructions that noticeably negatively affect the server's performance. This rule also includes turtle farms. For more information, [click here.](../rules-and-penalties/practice/buildings.md#id-4.2-unlawful-engineering-work)

**4.3 Unauthorized construction:** Anyone who intentionally constructs a trap, an arena, or other structure to harm or kill players is judged for unauthorized construction. The prohibition does not apply if the traps, arenas, or the construction in question and its risks are marked. Those who construct something that meets the criteria for "3.1 inappropriate language use" or "3.2 provocation" are judged for either unauthorized construction, inappropriate language use, or provocation.

**4.4 Unauthorized financial activities:** Anyone who organizes lotteries, casino games, or other types of games where a fee needs to be paid to participate is judged for unauthorized financial activities. Also, players who engage in activities that collect nominal interest on loaned euros or items are judged for unauthorized financial activities. _Permission can be given from moderators if there is a clear outline._
